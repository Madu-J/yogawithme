                    <p>The benefit of yoga doesn't end in excercising yourself only physically, but you also benefit mentalilly as it helps reduces stress.
                         Yoga can lower blood pressure and reduce insomnia related sickness. Yoga also do away with depression and for those that might have
                          difficulties in sleeping this is a welcome practice for them. This entirely depends on your goals and expectations. If your goal is
                        to build strength, flexibility, balance as well as posture, yoga is the right choice for you.
