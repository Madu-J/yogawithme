                        Yoga is a great form of exercise for people of all ages and physical abilities. Beginner yoga poses include
                        child's
                        pose, easy seat, tree pose, and down dog. Benefits of yoga for beginners include increased strength and
                        flexibility
                        and
                        reduced stress</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>Yoga can lower blood pressure and reduce insomnia. This entirely depends on your goals and

                        to build strength, flexibility, balance as well as
                        posture, yoga is the right choice for you. But if you want to build muscle, gym workout is the right choice. You
                        can
                        also create a balance of both by practising both.</figcaption>

                        detail, precision, and alignment from a series of Yoga postures, also known as Asanas</figcaption>
